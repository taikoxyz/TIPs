# TIPs -- Taiko Improvement Proposals

Welcome to the Taiko Improvement Proposals (TIPs) repo! Here is where we manage improvement proposals for Taiko. The repo is heavily inspired by [Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs)](https://eips.ethereum.org/).

Additionally, we strive for TIPs to be eligible for [Rollup Improvement Proposals (RIPs)](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/885) to benefit the entire L2 ecosystem. You can think of TIPs as the incubation grounds for improvement proposals beneficial to Taiko, and we'll do our best to cherry pick these changes in a way that is usable for all L2s by opening up an RIP.

Check out [TIP-0000](./TIP-0000.md) for the meta structure of a TIP. Thanks for stopping by!
