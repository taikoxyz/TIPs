# TIP-0001: Support reading and writing to the parent chain

**Stage**: Feedback

**Category**: Client

**Planned for RIP:** Yes

**Benefitting L2s:** All

## Abstract

[L1 calls](https://ethresear.ch/t/cross-layer-communication-trivially-provable-and-efficient-read-access-to-the-parent-chain/15396) open up a flexible design space for L2s. One direct use case we are interested in is supporting [booster rollups](https://ethresear.ch/t/booster-rollups-scaling-l1-directly/17125). Although they are called L1 calls, they can be used for any parent chain that the rollup syncs from.

We will introduce **three precompiles** in the L2 client specification of [taiko-geth](https://github.com/taikoxyz/taiko-geth) (or taiko-reth, etc.). These pre-compiles make use of the fact that an L2 node always has access to its parent chain. They allow for reading/writing real L1 state, as well as calling these in a sandbox:

- L1CALL: Execute an L1 smart contract.
- L1DELEGATECALL: Execute an L1 smart contract, but use the storage of the calling L2 contract.
- L1SANDBOXCALL: Execute any L1 smart contract, but discard all state changes after the call.

## Specification

We are proposing these addresses (see the section on backwards compatibility):

- L1CALL: `0x1000`
- L1DELEGATECALL: `0x1001`
- L1SANDBOXCALL: `0x1002`

One implementation of this feature could simply make RPC calls to the L1 node, but this could introduce significant latency.

One solution to this is to simply run L1 and L2 transactions in the same node (within the same networking stack), with just two different storage backends. This keeps the performance the same but increases the storage requirements for running the node.

The interface of the pre-compiled contracts for L1CALL, L1DELEGATECALL, and L1SANDBOXCALL all take in [2, 2 + n] arguments, where n = the number of arguments in the called function:

- [l1ContractAddress, l1ContractFunctionSignature, l1ContractFunctionArg1, …, l1ContractFunctionArgN]

## Implementation

A draft implementation can be found here: https://github.com/taikoxyz/taiko-geth/pull/129.

## Test Cases

Execute the following test script against the node which supports the aforementioned pre-compiles:

```solidity
// Contract deployed on L1
contract L1Contract {
    uint public count = 0; // slot 0
    function increment() public returns (uint) {
        count += 1;
        return count;
    }
}

// Contract deployed on L2
contract TestL1Calls {
    uint public l2Count = 2; // slot 0
    address l1Contract = "0x0h3...110";

    // pre-compile addresses
    address l1Call = "0x1000";
    address l1DelegateCall = "0x1001";
    address l1SandboxCall = "0x1002";

    function testL1Call() {
		bytes memory callIncrement = abi.encodePacked(l1Contract, abi.encodeWithSignature("increment()"));
        bytes memory callCount = abi.encodePacked(l1Contract, abi.encodeWithSignature("count()"));
		require(1 == l1Call.call(callIncrement);
        // assert state changes are persisted
        require(1 == l1Call.call(callCount);
    }

    function testL1DelegateCall() {
		bytes memory callIncrement = abi.encodePacked(address(this), abi.encodeWithSignature("increment()"));
        bytes memory callCount = abi.encodePacked(address(this), abi.encodeWithSignature("count()"));
        require(3 == l1DelegateCall.call(callIncrement);
        // assert l2 state is persisted
        require(3 == l1DelegateCall.call(callCount);
    }

    function testL1SandboxCall() {
		bytes memory callIncrement = abi.encodePacked(l1Contract, abi.encodeWithSignature("increment()"));
        bytes memory callCount = abi.encodePacked(l1Contract, abi.encodeWithSignature("count()"));
        require(1 == l1SandboxCall.call(l1Contract, "increment()"));
        // assert state changes are discarded
        require(0 == l1SandboxCall.call(l1Contract, "count()"));
    }
}
```

We will publish a library to make these calls simpler, but they should look like this under the hood.

## Backwards Compatibility

There is very little risk of breaking backwards-compatibility with this TIP, the sole issue being if someone were to build a contract relying on the addresses `0x1000`, `0x1001`, and `0x1002` being empty. The likelihood of this is low, and should specific instances arise, the address could be chosen to be any arbitrary value with negligible risk of collision.

We chose these addresses to be far away from the first 1000 which can be reserved for L1 pre-compiles.

## Security Considerations

These new pre-compiles have the same security risks as any other pre-compile covered by a validity proof system, there could be a bug in the proving system that allows for invalid usage of the pre-compiles to be considered as valid.

Therefore, it’s critical that any rollup that takes advantage of these pre-compiles has a good overall security mechanism, such as using multi-proofs.

## Additional Discussion Points

### `from` in the `eth_call` or `eth_debugTrace`

TODO, tx.origin/msg.sender

### Proving the correctness of L1 global variables

TODO

### Gas metering changes

Can swap out the storage backend so the gas cost is the same.

### Additional pre-compiles

- L1SSTORE, L1SLOAD, etc.

### Alternate naming ideas

Here are a few additional naming ideas. REMOTECALL is somewhat interesting because of Optimism’s REMOTESTATICCALL. The naming should be sensible and good for standardization.

- CROSSCALL, XCALL, REMOTECALL, PARENTCALL
